## How to Run

### Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run the pipeline
```bash
python main.py
```

---

## Output

Running the pipeline generates the following files in `output/`:
- `combined_books.csv` — full merged dataset (also saved to `data/` for reference)
- `avg_price.png` — average price comparison chart
- `avg_rating.png` — average rating comparison chart

> `output/` is excluded from the repository. Run the script to generate these files locally.
